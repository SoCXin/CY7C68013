README spi-mems
---------------

This example sets up the SPI port which is connected to
an onboard MEMS gyroscope. It uses SPI5 which happens to
be one of the SPI ports that aren't defined for other
variants of the STM32F4 family.

I'll confess that this mostly is a way to learn to use
the SPI port so that I can use it in the next example
with the LCD, but since the gyro was there I decided
to use it. Unfortunately I'm not at all sure how to
really use the Gyro. If you read the data sheet from
ST Micro it seems like it should do something useful
when you move the board around but I didn't achieve
that. Feel free to update this example with better
settings for the gyro chip.
